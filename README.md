# tarjan-isomorphic-mvd-coloring


This is a project where I implement the Tarjan algorithm to decompose a undirected graph to blocks and cut vertices. 

Also, I write a program based on Elementary Operations on Matrices to decide graph isomorphic and color graphs with their isomorphic graphs that have already been colored. 

For a more complex graph G, our code can effectively give the mvd-coloring of G, provided that there is a graph in type set isomorphic to block of G. Otherwise, the code is also able to select blocks that no graphs can be isomorphic to in type set. Meanwhile, the mvd-coloring of these blocks, once resolved, can further enrich our type set. Besides, the code can be adjusted to solve a series of coloring problems such as rd-coloring, rvd-coloring, etc. in a similar way.
