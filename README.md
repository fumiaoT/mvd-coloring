# tarjan-isomorphic


This is a project where I implement the Tarjan algorithm to decompose a undirected graph to blocks and cut vertices. 
Also, I write a program based on Elementary Operations on Matrices to decide graph isomorphic and color graphs with their isomorphic graphs that have already been colored.
